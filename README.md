# Simple_encode_decode
Simple encoding-decoding transmisstion messages for model training results in parameters, you can add one or more input and keys there are many of algorithms including ACS that is default or DCS and many algorithms this one is simplest to learn from networks communciatoins such as TCP/IP and transcription messages.

## Input ##

Create input as text vectorize, it is benefits you do it by using text vectorized or you can do it by token or simply dictionary method but it is not indicated the complexity except it is using for FF message ( fast forward message valid time is concern )
```
text = "I love cats"
tokenizer = tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer(num_words=10000, oov_token='<oov>')
tokenizer.fit_on_texts([text])

vocab = [ "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "I", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z", "_" ]
data = tf.constant([["_", "_", "_", "I"], ["l", "o", "v", "e"], ["c", "a", "t", "s"]])

layer = tf.keras.layers.StringLookup(vocabulary=vocab)
sequences_mapping_string = layer(data)
sequences_mapping_string = tf.constant( sequences_mapping_string, shape=(1,12) )
```

## Networks training ##

Model training for further prediction, if you do text vectorized mapping correct is part is very easy but you need to create of keys + input + variable from environment correctly and you do not need to make too much of the complex message composed that is because we need fast communicatons and it is only valid at the time they are in conversaition, salts or count number they telling space indicated or stikes.
```
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
: Model Initialize
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
	tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=( 12 ), batch_size=1, name='layer_input'),
	tf.keras.layers.Dense(12, activation='relu', name='layer_dense_1')
])

model.summary()

prediction = model.predict(sequences_mapping_string) # an integer
```

## Background logics ##

The encode-decoder background logics you can add keys or multiple inputs, I write this colum because to telling you that it is possible to revert back the original meesage when it has the correct conditions and when it is not totally or most of the part need to be repeat in patterns for you to know. Adding key is something as sequences as number from functions as create prime number with are not included 13 as some programs commmunications. üëßüí¨ Somebody find me Windows I need to kick butt out there.
```
decoder = tf.keras.layers.StringLookup(vocabulary=vocab, output_mode="int", invert=True)
result = decoder(sequences_mapping_string)
print( "encode: " + str( sequences_mapping_string ) )
print( "decode: " + str( result ) )

mapping_vocab = [ "_", "I", "l", "o", "v", "e", "c", "a", "t", "s" ]
string_matching = [ 27, 9, 12, 15, 22, 5, 3, 1, 20, 19 ]
string_matching_reverse = [ 1/27, 1/9, 1/12, 1/15, 1/22, 1/5, 1/3, 1/1, 1/20, 1/19 ]
